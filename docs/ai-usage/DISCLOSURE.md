# AI Usage Disclosure

## Overview

I used AI tools (ChatGPT) during the "Pizza Pantry" Next.js assessment to assist only with front-end development tasks. The AI was used as a helper, not as an automatic code generator. All code was fully reviewed, edited, and understood by me, and all implementation decisions were made manually.

## Where AI Was Used

• **Initial guidance on structuring the Next.js 15 App Router project**  
• **Suggestions for organizing feature folders** (inventory/, components/, api/)  
• **Drafting Zod validation schemas** for form fields  
• **Helping refine TypeScript types** and improving form error handling  
• **Generating UI examples** such as table layouts, modal structures, and loading/empty/error state patterns  
• **Suggestions for accessibility practices** (ARIA labels, keyboard flow)  
• **Reviewing component patterns** for the Add/Edit Item forms and Adjust Quantity modal

## What AI Was *Not* Used For

• **No backend business logic** was generated by AI  
• **No database models, queries, or MongoDB operations** were copied from AI  
• **No Clerk authentication logic** was generated by AI  
• **No API route handlers** (CRUD, quantity adjustments, or audit trail logic) were written by AI  
• **No deployment setups or environment configurations** were generated by AI

## Files Influenced

AI was only used to draft or refine front-end components such as:

- `/app/inventory/page.tsx`
- `/components/forms/ItemForm.tsx`
- `/components/inventory/AdjustQuantityModal.tsx`
- `/components/ui/empty-state.tsx`
- `/components/ui/table.tsx`

## Prompts Used

AI was asked for:

- UI layout ideas
- Best practices for client-side validation
- Improvements to component readability
- Lightweight sorting/filtering patterns

All prompts and chat logs are included in `/docs/ai-usage/` as required.

## Assurance

All code in this submission is original, verified, and adheres to licensing requirements. The AI was used only as an assistant to speed up front-end coding and not as a replacement for manual development.
